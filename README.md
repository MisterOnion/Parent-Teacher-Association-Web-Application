# Parent-Teacher-Association-Web-Application
A completed project from one of my University Modules (Software Engineering Fundamentals)

**Feature availability is configured with account/user roles**
Implemented features/ functionality:
1. Payment and Billing using Stripe API with a webhook to the Firestore Database.
2. Calendar with event insertion and sorting functions, implemented with FullCalendar API.
3. Account authentication, and user data management.
4. Announcement, billing, and fundraising posts with full features implemented.

Note: This is developed using pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without any frameworks. 

For anyone intending to emulate any aspect of this project, it is important to set up your local environment before proceeding.
1. Install dependencies using NPM. https://www.youtube.com/@r3habmedia/featured offers a comprehensive guide. (< 1 hour)
2. Set up a Stripe developer account with the necessary tokens. https://www.youtube.com/@elilopezdev/videos offers a series of clear steps. (< 40 minutes)

*IMPORTANT*
Adapting the design to your specific goals will require more time on your end. This project will have some kinks to iron out, which will be rectified in future projects.
